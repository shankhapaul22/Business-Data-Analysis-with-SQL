# Context

The Chinook record store has just signed a deal with a new record label, and you've been tasked with selecting the first three albums that will be added to the store, from a list of four. All four albums are by artists that don't have any tracks in the store right now - we have the artist names, and the genre of music they produce:

| Artist Name | Genre |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Regal      | Hip-Hop       |
| Red Tone   | Punk   |
| Meteor and the Girls|  Pop|
|Slime Jim Bites | Blues |

# Objective

We will be working with the `chinook.db` database to figure out which 3 record albums the store should add.

# Process

We create helper functions that we will use throughout the project to run sql commands and queries.

The record label specializes in artists in the USA. Therefore we analyzed popularity of genres in the USA.

We also did addtional research to find the employee performances, best countries to advertise and whether Chinook should continue to keep buying whole albums or individual tracks.

# Results

According to our research, Chinook should add the following albums from the 4 above to their store due to genre popularity in the USA.

- Regal (Hip-Hop)
- Slim Jim Bites (Blues)
- Meteor and the Girls (Pop)

All employees are performing in correlation to how long they have been working and there is no standout individual as off this analysis.

The best countries to run marketing campaigns would be Czech Republic, U.K. and India due to thier high total sales to customer ratio.
It is important to note the data can be skewed due to the small sample of customers in each of these countries.

Finally, due to 20% of sales come from whole albums, Chinook should continue to keep buying whole albums instead of just individual tracks.
