# Context

The Chinook record store has just signed a deal with a new record label, and you've been tasked with selecting the first three albums that will be added to the store, from a list of four. All four albums are by artists that don't have any tracks in the store right now - we have the artist names, and the genre of music they produce:

| Artist Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Regal      | Hip-Hop       |
| Red Tone   | Punk   |
| Meteor and the Girls|  Pop|
|Slime Jim Bites | Blues |
